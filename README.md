# GLVC

Tool to check if a Geometry Dash level has only features of a given version.

## Manual

1. Download the latest version in [GLVC](https://github.com/lucastozo/GLVC/releases), extract and run `GLVC.exe`
2. Insert a `.gmd` file path (for example: `"C:\path\to\your\folder\level.gmd"`)
3. Pick a GD version and check if the level is possible or not

## Example

In this example i will be checking if the level The Hell Zone by Sohn0924 is possible in Geometry Dash 1.2:

I specified where the level file is located, in my case, i exported the `.gmd` file of The Hell Zone in `C:\Users\Tozo\Desktop\levels`

And after specifying the file path, just pick a Geometry Dash version to check the level, in my case, i will be choosing `5 - 1.2`

In my example, The Hell Zone by Sohn0924 returned `Success: Possible Level` and the program waits any input to restart.
